/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented:user input limit
                         the reason why I didnt implemented it is the size of operator
                         and letter is different, it's hard to limit it by input.size()
                         unless I found out how to get the inputtext.x+inputtext.length
                         something like that
                         however sf::text doesnt seem to have that

        -Implemented: basic graphing calculator functions and operating functions
            zoom in and out pan up right left down with keyboard and mouse
            graph in polar and linear
            graph in point and line
            auto save and manual save history
            delete and clear history
            save graph before close and open it as when it closed


        -Partly implemented:

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
