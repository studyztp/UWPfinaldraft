## Quick Start

The repository only provides the source codes of the simulator. 
To compile the code, the following tools are required:

1. C++ compiler or compiling software (ex. [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools "QtCreator website"), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com "VSCode Website"))
2. [SFML library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php "sfml-tutorial")

It it compiles and builds correctly, you should see the Graphic Calculator window that looks like this:
