# Project Overview

This is a graphing calculator simulator project built based on the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org "sfml-dv.org"), a simple multi-media library. 

It is able to function like a real graphing calculator. For detail functionailities, please check the [Functionaility](Functionaility.md) section.

# Quick Start

The repository only provides the source codes of the simulator. 

To compile the code, the following tools are required:


1. C++ compiler or compiling software (ex. [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools "QtCreator website"), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com "VSCode Website"))
2. [SFML library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php "sfml-tutorial")


If it compiles and builds correctly, you should see the Graphic Calculator window that looks like this:

For detail commands, please check the [Functionaility](Functionaility.md) section.


## Basic Instructions
In this section, it will introduce the basic instructions to use the graphing calculator.

You can also press the button ![helpon](build-finalproject-Desktop_Qt_5_13_1_MinGW_64_bit-Debug/helpon.jpg) on the right panel to get breif instructions on each button.

By pressing the button ![helpoff](build-finalproject-Desktop_Qt_5_13_1_MinGW_64_bit-Debug/helpoff.jpg), the help messages will disapear.

  * [Enter Function](#enter-function)
  * [Move Around Graph](#move-around-graph)



## Enter Function
To change the function, first press the button ![ButtonEnter](build-finalproject-Desktop_Qt_5_13_1_MinGW_64_bit-Debug/enter.jpg) on the right panel or press 'Shift + F' on keyboard

Then, you will see a pop-up box on the left that looks like this:


![PopupBox](doc_res/EnterExample.jpg)


Type in the function on the box with your keyboard and finish with pressing the enter key on your keyboard.

If you enter an incorrect graphing function, you will see a yellow warnning sign at the end of the box. The warnning sign will dispear when you enter a correct graphing function.

Below is an example:

To exit the input mode, press 'ESC' on the keyboard or enter a correct function. 


## Move Around Graph

You can move around the graph using the right panel ![Left](build-finalproject-Desktop_Qt_5_13_1_MinGW_64_bit-Debug/left.jpg)/![Right](build-finalproject-Desktop_Qt_5_13_1_MinGW_64_bit-Debug/right.jpg)/![Up](build-finalproject-Desktop_Qt_5_13_1_MinGW_64_bit-Debug/up.jpg)/![Down](build-finalproject-Desktop_Qt_5_13_1_MinGW_64_bit-Debug/down.jpg) or the arrow keys on your keyboard.
They will both allow you to shift Left/Right/Up/Down on the graph.
